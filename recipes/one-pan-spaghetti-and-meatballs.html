    <h2> To serve</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>shaved or grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the minced beef, chopped onion, egg, parmesan, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper into a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Mix together using your hands, then form the mixture into 16-20 meatballs.</li>

            <li>Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan (skillet) and add in the meatballs.</li> 

            <li>Cook for 5-6 minutes on a medium-to-high heat, turning two or three times, until the meatballs are browned all over.</li>

            <li>Now we start adding the sauce ingredients to the pan. Move the meatballs to one side of the pan (or just make a bit of space). Add the onion, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>

            <li>Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring the vegetables a few times, until the onions start to soften.</li>

            <li>Add in the tin of tomatoes, tomato puree, thyme, brown sugar, crumbled stock cube, and the just-boiled water. Stir everything together and bring the sauce to the boil.</li>

            <li>Make a bit of space in the pan and add in the pasta (break it in half if it is too big to fit in your pan). Ensure the pasta is fully submerged in the sauce.</li>

            <li>Turn the heat down to low, place a lid on and cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until the pasta is cooked. </li>

            <li>When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and divide the spaghetti between 4 bowls, using a set of tongs. Spoon the meatballs and sauce on top.</li>

            <li>Finish with a little shaved parmesan and chopped parsley and serve.</li>
